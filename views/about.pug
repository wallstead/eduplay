            strong Project Description:  
            | EduPlay is an educational software for teachers to create their own custom educational games and a platform for students to be able to connect to their teachers account and play content they have created. Our goal for teachers is to make an intuitive and easy way for them to insert their own content into template games. This way teachers can easily integrate our software with their lesson plan. The software will also take care of any assignment grading for the teacher, making our software a convenient solution for large classes. Our goal for the students is to provide a barrier from failure, feedback while and after playing, and a path for further learning. Some students find the learning process frustrating, stressful, or they are simply uninterested because they feel they are lost and don’t know where to go for help. We are making this software to solve these problems for students by providing them with a safe, fun, and interactive learning environment. Students will have unlimited tries, just like a game, so as long as they are willing to try, the system will work with them for as long as it takes them to complete their assignment. Once a student has finished the assignment, they will realize it is just a small part of the game itself. To complete the game, or reach the best outcome, the student will have to play beyond the original assignment and is encouraged to achieve a higher level of mastery. Through this we hope to give students a next step up from the assignment to encourage further learning.

            | This site is completely functional. You can create a teacher account, create math and spelling games, and invite students to play the games. Once they play a game at least once, you can see their performance and what they need to work on.
